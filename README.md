Data Analysis: Conducts in-depth analysis on unemployment trends, personal income trends, and population growth rates, providing valuable insights into the economic landscape of each state.
Visualizations: Includes various visual representations, such as bar graphs for unemployment trends and personal income, using colorblind-friendly palettes to ensure accessibility.
Findings: Presents insights on the changes in unemployment rates pre- and post-2000, as well as trends in personal income and population growth across states.
